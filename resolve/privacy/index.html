                    </h4>
                    <p><b>4.1.</b> File Attachments: Stored exclusively in your organization's Microsoft 365 account. We
                        don't access these files directly.</p>
                    <p><b>4.2.</b> All incidents data is stored on secure servers in the U.S., with layers of security
                        to keep your information protected and in compliance with U.S. data protection laws. This data
                        is used solely for processing and managing incidents within your organization and is not used by
                        us for any other purpose.</p>
                    <p><b>4.3.</b> Data Encryption: All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.</p>
                    <p><b>4.4.</b> We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of
                        security appropriate to the risk.</p>
                    <p><b>4.5.</b> Access to the stored incident data is strictly limited to authorized personnel within
                        your organization and our technical team for maintenance and support purposes only.</p>
                    <p><b>4.6.</b> Data Retention and Disposal: When an organization administrator requests to close
                        their organization's account, we retain all organization data for 30 days from the date of the
                        request. During this retention period, all data remains securely stored and can be accessed if
                        the administrator requests to reactivate the account. After the 30-day retention period, all
                        organization data, including incident history, requests, and associated information for all
                        users within the organization, is permanently and securely deleted from our systems with no
                        possibility of recovery. This process ensures both data security and organizational privacy
                        while providing a reasonable timeframe for potential account reactivation or data recovery if
                        needed. Only organization administrators have the ability to request account closure.</p>
